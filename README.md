# Statistics-Descriptive-PDL
Intended as a drop-in replacement for [Statistics::Descriptive](https://metacpan.org/pod/Statistics::Descriptive) but using [PDL](http://pdl.perl.org) objects for the back end.  It will presumably be faster due to PDL's speed, but that is something that can be tested.

It is hoped that this will ultimately lead to an easier implementation of weighted statistics, as there are indexing and installation issues with [Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted](https://metacpan.org/pod/Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted) (amongst other issues with functionality).
