=head1 NAME

Statistics::Descriptive::PDL - A close to drop-in replacement for
Statistics::Descriptive using PDL as the back-end

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.08

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS


    use Statistics::Descriptive::PDL;

    my $stats = Statistics::Descriptive::PDL->new();
    $stats->add_data(1,2,3,4);
    my $mean = $stat->mean;
    my $var  = $stat->variance();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics.


=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

Create a new statistics object.  Takes no arguments.

=item add_data (@data)

=item add_data (\@data)

Add data to the stats object.  Passed through to the underlying PDL object.
Appends to any existing data.

Multidimensional data are flattened into a singe dimensional array.

=item clear_cache

Clears any cached results on an object.

=item available_stats

Method to return a list of the available statistics.

=item geometric_mean

=item harmonic_mean

=item max

=item mean

=item median

=item min

=item mode

=item sample_range

=item standard_deviation

=item sum

=item variance

The above should need no explanation, except that they
use the unbiased methods where appropriate, as per Statistics::Descriptive.

=item count

Number of data items that have been added.


=item skewness

=item kurtosis

Skewness and kurtosis to match that of MS Excel.
If you are used to R then these are the same as type=2
in e1071::skewness and e1071::kurtosis.


=item percentile (10)

=item percentile (45)

The percentile calculation differs from Statistics::Descriptive in that it uses
linear interpolation to determine the values, and thus does not
return the exact same values as the input data.

=item percentiles (10, 20, 30)

A simple wrapper around the percentile method to allow calculation of
multiple values in one call.

=item iqr

The inter-quartile range.  A convenience method to calculate the
difference between the 75th and 25th percentile.

=back

=head2 Not yet implemented, and possibly won't be.

Any of the trimmed functions, frequency functions and some others.

=over

=item least_squares_fit

=item trimmed_mean

=item quantile

=item mindex

=item maxdex

=back
