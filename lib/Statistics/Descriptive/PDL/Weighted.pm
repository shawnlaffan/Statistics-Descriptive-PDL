=head1 NAME

Statistics::Descriptive::PDL::Weighted - A close to drop-in replacement for
Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted using PDL as the back-end

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.09

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS


    use Statistics::Descriptive::PDL::Weighted;

    my $stats = Statistics::Descriptive::PDL::Weighted->new;
    $stats->add_data([1,2,3,4], [1,3,5,6]);  #  values then weights
    my $mean = $stats->mean;
    my $var  = $stats->variance;
    
    #  or you can add data using a hash ref
    my %data = (1 => 1, 2 => 3, 3 => 5, 4 => 6);
    $stats->add_data(\%data);
    
    #  if you want equal weights then you need to supply them yourself
    my $data = [1,2,3,4];
    $stats->add_data($data, [(1) x scalar @$data]);
    
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics
using weighted values.  


=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

Create a new statistics object.  Takes no arguments.  

=item add_data (\%data)

=item add_data ([1,2,3,4], [0.5,1,0.1,2)

Add data to the stats object.  Appends to any existing data.

If a hash reference is passed then the keys are treated as the numeric data values,
with the hash values the weights.

Unlike Statistics::Descriptive::PDL, you cannot pass a single flat array
since odd things might happen if we convert it to a hash and the values
are multidimensional.

Since the L<PDL::pdl> function is used to process the data and weights you should be able to
specify anything pdl accepts as valid.

An exception is raised the weights are <= 0, or are not the same size as the data.

=item values_are_unique

=item values_are_unique (1)

Flag to indicate if the data have duplicate values.
Pass a true value to indicate your data have no
duplicate values, making the median and percentile
calculations faster (at the risk of you not being correct).

=item sum_wts

Sum of the weights vector.

=item Statistical methods

Most of the methods should need no explanation here,
except to note that the standard_deviation, skewness and kurtosis 
use the biased methods.  This is because one cannot guarantee the data are sample counts.
The same applies to the median and percentiles.  The median uses a centre of mass calculation, and the
percentiles using analogous approach.  This is because the weights are not guaranteed
to be integers and so there is no sense interpolating.

Use L<Statistics::Descriptive::PDL::SampleWeighted> when your weights are counts
and you need the unbiased methods.  

The iqr is the inter-quartile range, calculated as the difference of the 75th and 25th percentiles. 

=item geometric_mean

=item harmonic_mean

=item max

=item mean

=item median

=item min

=item mode

=item sample_range

=item standard_deviation

=item sum

=item variance

=item count 

=item skewness

=item kurtosis

=item percentile (10)

=item percentile (45)

=item iqr

=head2 Not yet implemented, and possibly won't be.

Any of the trimmed functions, frequency functions and some others.
